# Shape Tetris

This project is built for fun.

## How it works

A shape can be dragged into the board and from then on, it acts as a tetris. The newly added shape can change positions using the "Left" and "Right" keys. It can also rotate by either pressing the keys "Up" or "Down". If the user is not satisfied with the position, he can drag the shape to a new position where he can also rotate it.
PS: A shape cannot rotate or change positions when it's landed or in other words not in motion.
